# Greenbank Lab Environment: Intro and Etiquette

*Last updated February 2021.*

The Greenbank Lab Environment has been established for the purpose of creating a space for the as- Oops, wrong document. It's been established for the purpose of giving SAD members an always-on, remotely-accessible environment to practice Linux administration, virtualization, basic networking, identity management technologies, web hosting, and so on. And just to have fun with.

**It's here for YOU, so please, make use of it!** Don't be afraid of using up resources or breaking something. The beauty of virtualization is that it allows us to back up everything anyways. If you use too many resources, we'll let you know. It's been built for you guys, so have fun with it.

That said, it is a shared computing environment running on our own physical hardware, so we have to set some reasonable restrictions. This document will explain how to make use of the environment and how to be a good "SAD citizen".

## Da Rules üìò

### Rule One: Don't break other people's stuff üî®

Don't *intentionally* break the infrastructure or other people's VMs.

So don't spam the shutdown buttons or screw up the proxy or whatever just because you feel like it. We trust all of you to not do that, and I really doubt anyone will ever break something intentionally, but it had to be said.
- Note: Breaking your *own* VMs is allowed; encouraged, even. Do whatever you want to your own stuff, as long as you're reasonably certain nobody else is using it.
- Security "recon" is allowed, think `nmap` and similar tools... again, encouraged, even. You can *find* security holes, just don't exploit them to harm stuff. There's various personal info on here, if you manage to access it, don't snoop around in it.
- Finally, again, this is about *intentional* damage. If you break stuff in the process of trying to set something up, "c'est la vie". Who cares. We just restore to the last snapshot or backup. We won't be mad, we'll be happy you're learning.

### Rule Two: Don't let the bad guys in üïµÔ∏è‚Äç

Don't create security holes.

Basically that means be careful with the **firewall** and the **VPN**. Don't create port-forwards without getting approval. Don't work around the firewall (reverse shells and other such tunnels). Don't give out your VPN cert. If your VPN cert is compromised, you must inform us *immediately* so that we can revoke the certificate. We have an internal security system but it's best not to rely on it.

It also means don't test **malware** on Greenbank systems. Malware is cool and fun, but it's more the domain of the Cyberdawgs and Malware Research Group, not us. If you'd really like to try it, let the board know and we'll make a specially-secured VM for that purpose.

## Getting Started: VPN Access and Changing your Password üë©‚Äçüéì

Now that that's over with - we'll explain how to actually get logged in!

You should have been given a username and a default password.

You should have also been given an `ovpn` file with your VPN certificate. This file (plus your password) is what grants you access to the internal network. Guard it closely. Again, if this file gets compromised (say your machine is stolen or you find out you have a bad malware infection) tell us ASAP and we'll revoke your cert and give you a fresh one.

If you weren't given all this stuff then contact the board to get access!

Anyways, you'll need to install OpenVPN...

### Installing and Connecting üíª

Note: If the VPN client asks you whether you want to save the password, for now, leave that unchecked (do not save password), since we'll be changing your password in a minute.

- **Windows**: Go here [https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/) and grab the Windows 64-bit MSI installer and install it. You should see OpenVPN GUI in your start menu now; open it. It should pop up a little screen with a lock on it in your notifications tray, like [this](https://i.imgur.com/6TB126q.png). Right-click on it, and click `Import File...`. Find the `.ovpn` file you were given (it should be something like `sadgreenbank-yourname-2021-02-06.ovpn`) and import it. Then hit Connect. Log in with the username and password we gave you. If there's a failure/error you might need to reboot your machine (or restart the Service, but reboot is easier).
- **Mac**: Go here [https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/connecting-to-access-server-with-macos/](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/connecting-to-access-server-with-macos/) and scroll to `OpenVPN Connect v3` and grab the `OpenVPN Connect v3 for macOS` installer. Install it and use the GUI to import the `.ovpn` file and connect. Log in with the username and password we gave you.
- **Linux**: Instructions are available here [https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/connecting-to-access-server-with-linux/](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/connecting-to-access-server-with-linux/). Generally you should probably install the OpenVPN Client using the package manager for your particular distro. Follow the instructions and run the appropriate command to connect, probably `openvpn --config [yourfilegoeshere].ovpn`. Log in with the username and password we gave you.
- **BSD**: IDK google it
- **Plan 9**: wha- üëÄ

### Testing VPN Connectivity üîå

If the connection window disappears and now you have a green status icon, or a checkmark, or something similar, then you should be connected.

Try, in the terminal, `ping 192.168.1.50` and `ping 192.168.1.1`. If both of these work, then you should be good to go. Try visiting [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) in your web browser (you'll need to clear the self-signed-cert warning; in Firefox hit `Advanced...` then `Accept the Risk and Continue`, for example). You should see the pfSense login page. You should be able to log in with your username and password, though it'll probably just give you an error screen as you have no pfSense perms by default. If any of these steps failed, let us know.

Now we should test the DNS. Try going to [https://pfsense.greenbank.lan](https://pfsense.greenbank.lan) in your browser. This should take you to the same page you were on before. If it doesn't work, let us know.

Basically, if you can go to [https://pfsense.greenbank.lan](https://pfsense.greenbank.lan) in your browser and see the pfSense login screen, then the VPN is working. Cool!

### Changing Your Password üîê

Please change your password (and remember it; or even better, put it in a password manager) before you disconnect. We'd really like everyone to not be using the default passwords.

Note: Passwords are hashed, salted, and stored securely in FreeIPA... but this is nevertheless a shared lab environment, potentially vulnerable to data breaches or MITM attacks. *Please* don't use, like, the same password that you've used for your bank accounts and UMBC accounts here. Please make a unique password.

Go to [https://ipa.greenbank.lan](https://ipa.greenbank.lan) in your browser and log in using your default username and password. It should succeed, then say `Your password has expired. Please enter a new password.` and immediately prompt you to make a password change. Enter your current password (the default one we provided you) and then your desired new password. Leave the OTP field blank. Submit the form.

This should bring you to your user account page. Feel free to customize it and give yourself a job title or phone number or something, I guess. (Don't add your address unless you want the entirety of SAD visiting your house.)

Once you've changed your password, disconnect your VPN, then try re-connecting. This time you can check the box to save your password, if you're comfortable with that. VPN connection should now take no longer than 5-10 seconds, since all you have to do is right click > Connect. **We're all done!**

### Further Steps üìö

The full Greenbank environment will be explained in the link in the next section, but the base infrastructure of the system consists of three hosts.

- **Proxmox**: Accessible via [https://proxmox.greenbank.lan:8006](https://proxmox.greenbank.lan:8006). This is the management UI of the actual hypervisor which runs all the virtual machines. This is where you make new VMs and get console access to VMs.
- **pfSense**: Accessible via [https://pfsense.greenbank.lan](https://pfsense.greenbank.lan). This is the firewall which sits between the VMs' private network and the Internet, and provides DHCP and DNS services to the private network. It also runs the OpenVPN server.
- **FreeIPA**: Accessible via [https://ipa.greenbank.lan](https://ipa.greenbank.lan). This is the Identity Management server which holds all the user accounts, passwords, and group assignments. Other services use LDAP to get authentication/user info.

Feel free to visit these hosts in your web browser and try logging in. By default you probably don't have sufficient permissions to do much of anything, but those will be granted soon.

### User Etiquette

There is one main shared environment where we should have some common etiquette: Proxmox.

- There are three main "resource pools" where VMs must be placed: SAD_Sandbox, SAD_General, and SAD_Infrastructure.
  - SAD_Sandbox is open to newer members and generally hosts temporary VMs that will be the first to go if we need to delete some to free up space. Just put whatever you want in here, TBH.
  - SAD_General is the general-purpose pool; it's open to established members (attended a few meetings and have used the Greenbank system a little bit). Try to limit VMs in this category to those that you want to stay up for an extended period of time (more than a week, say), or those that you want to be accessible to other members.
  - SAD_Infrastructure is open only to authorized members (board, experienced members, etc). It hosts "critical infrastructure" like pfSense and FreeIPA that we don't really want to give out console access to. Note: In many cases you can still obtain user-level access to these via the Web UI.
- Try and put stuff in the appropriate resouce pool (though it doesn't really matter all that much).
- If you're making a VM just for your own personal use, prepend your name to the VM name and hostname.
  - So instead of `ubuntu` for a Ubuntu workstation, I'd call it `nikola-ubuntu` or similar.
  - Try to do this both for the VM name itself (in the Proxmox VM creation dialog) and the hostname of the guest OS (when you're installing the OS onto the VM).
  - Note: Others will still have console access to your VM. If you'd really like a VM for your own exclusive use, just ask us and we can set one up using Proxmox permissions.
  
Outside of Proxmox, just use common sense. And a note: **There's pretty much nothing in this system that is permanently blocked off.** What this means is, we *want* you all to move around and explore how this thing works. **The permissions system is just there to prevent trolling or silly mistakes, not because we don't trust you.** Want to see how the VPN is set up in pfSense? Just ask and we'll give you admin perms. Want to try adding Kerberos to FreeIPA? Again, just ask. If you want to get access to something, just ask one of us, and we'll *probably* give you access. Thanks to FreeIPA, it's not hard.

Have fun!
