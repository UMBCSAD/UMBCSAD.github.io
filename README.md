## Project List
Our projects are chosen by club members, typically at the start of the year.

1. This **website**! (Please make a pull request if you have any ideas!)
2. The **campus map project**, an interactive "slippy" web map of the UMBC campus. Written in Flask, and making use of the Mapbox-GL library with OSM data. Hosted on our own hardware. Current features include a working map with a customized symbology/theme and optional 3D mode. Planned features include floor plans, indoor points of interest, user-editability, and additional layers.
3. The **Minecraft modding project**, a set of Minecraft mods that will allow club members to expand their skills in Java development, API usage, and CI (continuous integration) setup. We also plan to host and administer our own Minecraft servers for club access.
4. The **Greenbank lab environment**, a completely virtualized (thanks Proxmox), VPN-accessible environment for club members to develop their skills in Linux administration, basic networking, identity management technologies, containerization, and just have fun.
5. ~~The **mobile app workshop**, a planned multi-meeting workshop sometime in the Spring 2021 semester for members to learn mobile app development.~~ Done!
6. The **networking meeting**, a multi-day lecture-style meeting on all things networking planned for the Fall 2021 semester.

## Meeting List
It's called a calendar!
